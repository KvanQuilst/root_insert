# 3D Printable Root Box Insert
This is an OpenSCAD interpretation of [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4749383)
Thingiverse project. However, the creator of the project said they won't be adapting
things to accomodate all of the faction content post-Homeland expansion release.

That's where the efforts of this project come in: to remix the great inserts from
badford25 in order to accomdate the new Homeland factions as well as all three decks
(Base, Exiles and Partisans, and Squires and Disciples). To accomodate this, each
factions insert has been put on it's side and given a lid and each faction with
additonal cards get an extra insert to accomodate the cards.

## Major Features
- All 13 factions: Base, Riverfolk, Underworld, Marauders, Homeland factions
- All 3 decks: Base, Exiles and Partisans, Squires and Disciples
- All Landmarks: The Tower and Raft (Underworld), Landmarks Pack, Homeland landmarks
- Needed pieces for gameplay:
  - 3 Battle Dice Pairs
  - Cardboard Clearing Markers
  - Ruins and 2 sets of Ruins items
  - Mountain Map Path Covers
  - Craftable Item Supply
 
## Using this Project
All finished 3D print files will be uploaded to Thingiverse here: *Thingiverse project not ready*

However, should you want to edit or build from source yourself, here are the key insights:
- You can directly export to `.stl` files for printing if desired
- **RECOMMENDED** Open parts in FreeCAD to add chambers and such for a better printing experience (the Thingiverse files have this done already)
